Solution Extraction Using PIG

1.Loadig Data to a variable:
Crime = Load ‘user/input/CRIME3.csv’ USING PigStorage(‘,’) as (inc_no:int,offense:int,offense_code:chararray,off_descript:chararray,district:int,reporting_area:int,occurance_date:datetime,year:int,month:int,day:chararray, hour:int,street:chararray);
From this we can load the dataset to a particular variable by giving the correct path of the input file location and after finding the file location we save the data based on the structure we provide.

2.Describing the dataset loaded:(Structure)
	a = describe crime;
	From this query we can able to see the structure of the dataset and their respective datatypes.

3.Setting limit to print or to display the dataset:
a = LIMIT crime 5;
From this we can able to print the first 5 rows of the dataset by providing the limit.

4. Displaying the dataset:
		dump a;
This query is able to provide or to display the data. 

5. Displaying the Offences:

6.Displaying the occurrence of offences

7. Displaying the Occurrence of crime-fraud

8.Displaying the crimes in D4 district

9. Illustrate command
